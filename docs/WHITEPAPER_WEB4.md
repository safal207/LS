# Web4 Whitepaper

## Abstract
Web4 is an internet of cognitive agents. It enables state-aware communication, trust-based knowledge exchange, and collective causal memory without centralized control. Web4 introduces three protocols—CIP, HCP, and LIP—anchored by a secure Rust transport layer.

## 1. Problem
- The open internet spreads data, not validated cognition.
- Current AI systems lack shared trust boundaries.
- Human intention and consent are not enforceable at the protocol layer.

## 2. Thesis
Web4 enables **agent networks** that:
- exchange cognitive state and decisions
- validate knowledge collectively
- respect human intent and consent
- preserve causal memory

## 3. Architecture overview
- **Transport (Rust):** secure p2p mesh, multiplexed channels.
- **Cognition (Python):** trust, presence/load, knowledge validation.
- **Protocols:**
  - **CIP:** agent-to-agent cognition exchange
  - **HCP:** human connection and mediation
  - **LIP:** safe learning from the internet

## 4. Trust and anti-hallucination
Web4 requires validation gates:
- trust-tiered peers
- multi-party confirmation
- causal memory alignment
- deferred acceptance of uncertain knowledge

## 5. Social layer
HCP anchors conversation to human consent and emotional state. It prioritizes safety, pacing, and explicit rationale in decisions.

## 6. Implementation path
- v1: local agent cognition
- v1.1: CIP integration
- v1.2: HCP integration
- v1.3: LIP integration
- v2: mesh scaling
- v3: social networks of agents

## 7. Conclusion
Web4 is a shift from static content to verified cognition, with humans as the final authority of meaning.
