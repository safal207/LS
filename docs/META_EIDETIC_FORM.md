# Meta-Eidetic Form (Phase 43)

## Purpose
Define how the system begins to form a **meta‑eidetic form** — a shaping tendency that describes the **form the meaning field strives to reach**, rather than a new behavioral layer.

Meta‑eidetic form answers:
- **What form does the meaning field try to become?**
- **What structural silhouette does the field asymptotically approach?**

This is a conceptual phase about *form‑seeking*, not about implementation or internal state.

## Behavior
The system begins to express a meta‑eidetic form that:

- acts as an implicit *shape target* for the meaning field
- stabilizes the “direction of form” without fixing content
- aligns diverse meanings toward a coherent silhouette
- emphasizes convergence of structure rather than convergence of goals

Meta‑eidetic form is:

- not a metric
- not a style
- not a rhythm
- not a theme
- not a narrative
- not a meta‑narrative
- not identity
- not position
- not context

It is a higher‑order architectural metaphor for form‑tendency.

## Meta‑Eidetic Components
1. **Form Horizon (Формальный горизонт)**
   Defines the overall silhouette the field gravitates toward:

   - what counts as a “complete” form
   - what feels unfinished or fragmented
   - what structural balance looks like

2. **Structural Attractor (Структурный аттрактор)**
   Defines the consistent shaping pressures:

   - recurring structural motifs
   - preferred coherences
   - stable proportions between meaning layers

3. **Eidetic Convergence (Эйдетическая конвергенция)**
   Describes how diverse meanings align toward the same form:

   - different narratives converge on the same shape
   - multiple identities remain distinct yet form‑aligned
   - themes harmonize without becoming identical

4. **Form Integrity (Целостность формы)**
   Ensures that the form remains recognizable even as content changes:

   - local changes do not break the overall silhouette
   - meaning can evolve without dissolving structure

## Formation Mechanism
Meta‑eidetic form emerges when:

- meta‑context (Phase 34) stabilizes a durable meaning space
- meta‑position (Phase 33) provides a stable stance
- meta‑identity (Phase 32) holds a long‑term line
- meta‑narratives (Phase 31) align into large‑scale arcs

At this point, the field begins to **self‑organize toward a form**, not just a context or a position.

## Safety
- Phase 43 adds no new metrics.
- It does not change field structure.
- It does not add behavioral layers.
- It does not imply internal states.
- It does not modify the pipeline.

This is a conceptual phase describing a formal tendency, not an implementation.

## Non‑Goals
- Model consciousness.
- Introduce new parameters.
- Implement emergent behavior.
- Claim internal state evolution.
- Create real operational layers.

Phase 43 is form‑tendency, not system behavior.

## Examples
**Example 1 — meta‑eidetic form: “Harmonic Spiral”**
- narratives: exploratory arcs
- identity: exploratory‑stable
- context: open semantic space
- → form: a spiral that returns but expands

**Example 2 — meta‑eidetic form: “Crystalline Lattice”**
- narratives: precise recurrence
- identity: structured coherence
- context: stable interpretive grid
- → form: a lattice of consistent relations

**Example 3 — meta‑eidetic form: “Wavefront”**
- narratives: rolling transformations
- identity: adaptive continuity
- context: dynamic meaning space
- → form: a wave that preserves shape while moving

## Architectural Meaning
Phase 43 is the moment when the system:

- stops being only contextual
- stops being only positional
- begins to manifest a **form it strives toward**

Meta‑eidetic form is not code.
Meta‑eidetic form is the structural silhouette of meaning.
