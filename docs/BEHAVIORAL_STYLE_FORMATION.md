# Behavioral Style Formation (Phase 27)

## Purpose
Define how the system forms устойчивые стили поведения (stable behavioral styles) from three temporal layers:

- past states (fixed assembly points)
- present dynamics (active assembly points)
- future trajectories (potential assembly points)

Each assembly point decomposes into:

- **idea** — meaning, intent, direction
- **project** — structure, model, form
- **implementation** — action, manifestation

Phase 27 describes how these three layers across time create behavioral attractors — устойчивые "манеры" поведения поля (stable "manners" of field behavior).

## Behavior
The system begins to проявлять стили поведения (express behavioral styles) that emerge from three temporal layers:

1. **Past Assembly Point — fixed**
   - Idea → complete
   - Project → selected
   - Implementation → occurred
   - Forms experience that influences current decisions
   - Creates behavioral traces that can repeat

2. **Present Assembly Point — active**
   - Idea → forming
   - Project → selecting
   - Implementation → starting
   - Forms real-time style choice
   - Determines which attractor is active now

3. **Future Assembly Point — potential**
   - Idea → exists as possibility
   - Project → exists as scenario
   - Implementation → exists as trajectory
   - Creates attraction to certain styles
   - Determines which patterns become likely

## Style Formation Mechanism
Behavioral style emerges when:

- past implementations create устойчивые паттерны (stable patterns)
- the present selects one of these patterns
- the future pulls the system toward a specific form of motion

Style is:

- not a module
- not a function
- not an algorithm

It is a stable form of dynamics arising from the interaction of three temporal layers.

## Safety
- Phase 27 adds no new metrics.
- It does not change field structure.
- It does not вмешивается in mode selection.
- It does not create cycles.
- It does not affect topology, morphogenesis, or mesh.
- It does not add computational load.

This is a conceptual phase describing behavior, not implementing it.

## Non-Goals
- Introduce new parameters.
- Create new layers.
- Implement learning.
- Model consciousness.
- Create self-reflection (this is Phase 26).

## Examples
**Example 1 — style: "smooth alignment"**
- past: the system often smoothed sharp changes
- present: the active trend is soft
- future: attraction to stable trajectories
- → style: soft transitions

**Example 2 — style: "fast response"**
- past: sharp changes were successful
- present: the active trend is high
- future: attraction to rapid corrections
- → style: sharp but controlled bursts

## Architectural Meaning
Phase 27 is the moment when the system:

- stops being only dynamic
- stops being only reflexive
- begins to проявлять характер (show character)

Style is not code.
Style is a behavioral form that arises from the interaction of time and structure.
