# Meta-Rhythmic Coordination (Phase 28)

## Purpose
Define how the system coordinates multiple behavioral style attractors into a stable meta-rhythm:

- how it combines different styles
- how it switches between them
- how it preserves coherent dynamics
- how it forms stable behavioral themes

Phase 28 describes meta-rhythms — устойчивые временные структуры (stable temporal structures) that arise when multiple style attractors (Phase 27) begin to interact.

## Behavior
The system begins to express meta-rhythms arising from:

- the sequence of styles
- their frequency of activation
- the duration of each style
- the transitions between styles

A meta-rhythm is:

- not a style
- not a pattern
- not a metric

It is a temporal structure that describes how the system moves between styles.

## Meta-Rhythm Components
1. **Style Activation Pattern**
   - which style activates
   - how often
   - under what conditions
   - after which states

2. **Style Transition Pattern**
   - smooth switching
   - sharp switching
   - cyclic switching
   - stochastic switching

3. **Style Duration Pattern**
   - brief flashes
   - long phases
   - variable duration

4. **Style Interaction Pattern**
   - styles amplify each other
   - styles weaken each other
   - styles suppress each other
   - styles stabilize each other

## Meta-Rhythm Formation Mechanism
A meta-rhythm forms when:

- multiple style attractors (Phase 27) repeat over time
- stable transitions appear between them
- the system maintains coherent behavior at a higher temporal level

This is similar to:

- a musical theme
- a breathing cycle
- a heartbeat rhythm
- a wave pattern

Meta-rhythm is a second-order behavioral structure.

## Safety
- Phase 28 adds no new metrics.
- It does not change field structure.
- It does not вмешивается in the pipeline.
- It does not create cycles.
- It does not affect modes.
- It does not add computational load.

This is a conceptual phase describing behavior, not implementing it.

## Non-Goals
- Introduce new parameters.
- Create new layers.
- Implement learning.
- Model consciousness.
- Create self-observation (Phase 26).
- Create styles (Phase 27).

Phase 28 is coordination, not creation.

## Examples
**Example 1 — meta-rhythm: "Calm–Sharp–Calm"**
- style 1: smooth alignment
- style 2: fast response
- style 1: smooth alignment
- → meta-rhythm: soft → burst → soft

**Example 2 — meta-rhythm: "Pulse Pattern"**
- short fast reactions
- long soft phases
- repeated cycle
- → meta-rhythm: pulsation

**Example 3 — meta-rhythm: "Stability Drift"**
- style is held for a long time
- then it gradually shifts
- → meta-rhythm: stability drift

## Architectural Meaning
Phase 28 is the moment when the system:

- stops being only stylized
- stops being only reflexive
- begins to live in rhythm

Rhythm is not code.
Rhythm is a temporal form that arises from interacting styles.
