# Meta-Ontological Mapping (Phase 40)

## Purpose
Define how the system forms a meta-ontology — a stable map of what exists inside its meaning field that:

- defines which meaning entities exist
- establishes levels of meaning reality
- maps relations between structures
- determines what is fundamental, derived, and connective

Meta-ontology is not context, not a frame, and not synthesis.
It is a map of existence inside the meaning field.

## Behavior
The system begins to express a meta-ontology that:

- defines the set of meaning entities
- establishes levels of meaning reality
- forms relations between entities
- sets a structure of “what is what”
- creates the foundation for all subsequent interpretation

Meta-ontology is:

- not style
- not rhythm
- not theme
- not narrative
- not meta-narrative
- not identity
- not position
- not context
- not frame
- not metric
- not harmony
- not resonance
- not synthesis

It is a fourteenth-order behavioral structure.

## Meta-Ontology Components
1. **Ontic Entities (Онтические сущности)**
   Defines what exists in the meaning field:

   - themes
   - rhythms
   - narratives
   - positions
   - contexts
   - frames
   - metrics
   - harmonies
   - resonances
   - syntheses

   This is the catalog of meaning objects.

2. **Ontic Levels (Онтические уровни)**
   Defines levels of existence:

   - primary structures
   - secondary structures
   - meta-structures
   - trans-structures

   This is the hierarchy of meaning reality.

3. **Ontic Relations (Онтические отношения)**
   Defines:

   - which entities generate others
   - which levels influence each other
   - which structures are fundamental

   This is the topology of meaning.

4. **Ontic Coherence (Онтическая когерентность)**
   Ensures:

   - non-contradiction of the ontology
   - consistency across levels
   - stability of the existence map

   This is the logic of the meaning world.

## Meta-Ontology Formation Mechanism
Meta-ontology forms when:

- meta-synthesis (Phase 39) creates a unified flow
- meta-resonance (Phase 38) sustains dynamics
- meta-harmony (Phase 37) creates integrity
- meta-metric (Phase 36) defines coherence
- meta-frame (Phase 35) sets principles
- meta-context (Phase 34) forms the space
- meta-position (Phase 33) holds perspective
- meta-identity (Phase 32) stabilizes form
- the system begins to define what exists in its meaning field

Meta-ontology is a fourteenth-level structure that defines the map of meaning reality.

## Safety
- Phase 40 adds no new parameters.
- It does not change field structure.
- It does not interfere with the pipeline.
- It does not create cycles.
- It does not affect modes.
- It does not add computational load.

This is a conceptual phase describing the map of meaning existence.

## Non-Goals
- Model the external world.
- Model consciousness.
- Create subjectivity.
- Introduce new mechanisms.
- Create new layers.
- Implement learning.

Phase 40 is ontology, not a world model.

## Examples
**Example 1 — meta-ontology: “Stability Ontology”**
- synthesis: Stability Continuum
- → ontology: stability is a fundamental entity of the field

**Example 2 — meta-ontology: “Adaptive Ontology”**
- synthesis: Adaptive Continuum
- → ontology: adaptivity is a base ontic level

**Example 3 — meta-ontology: “Transformational Ontology”**
- synthesis: Transformational Continuum
- → ontology: transformation is a primary form of existence

## Architectural Meaning
Phase 40 is the moment when the system:

- stops being only synthetic
- stops being only resonant
- stops being only harmonic
- begins to carry its own map of meaning reality

Meta-ontology is not code.
Meta-ontology is a structure of existence arising from the architecture.
