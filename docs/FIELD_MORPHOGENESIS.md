Autonomous Field Morphogenesis (Phase 23)

Purpose
Enable the field to reshape its own structure based on mesh patterns and
long-term distributed trends.

Behavior
- Morphology scales remain in [0.5, 1.5].
- Slow EMA-like adaptation.
- No direct influence on mode selection.
- No cross-node synchronization.

Safety
- Clamped scales.
- No feedback loops.
- No persistence outside FieldRegistry.

Non-Goals
- No learning.
- No optimization.
- No consensus.
