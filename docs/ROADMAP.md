# Web4 Roadmap

## v1.0 — Local agent core (in progress)
- Local cognition loop
- LPI/LRI/LTP primitives
- DMP + causal memory

## v1.1 — CIP integration (in progress)
- Rust transport + p2p channels
- CIP envelope + message types
- Trust FSM + anti-hallucination gates

## v1.2 — HCP integration (planned)
- Human state model
- Consent/intent mediation
- Social causal memory and feedback

## v1.3 — LIP integration (planned)
- Source trust tiers
- Deferred acceptance queue
- Cross-agent verification

## v2.0 — Web4 mesh (planned)
- Mesh routing hints
- Peer discovery and clustering
- Multi-agent consensus workflows

## v3.0 — Web4 social networks (planned)
- Human-agent collectives
- Community governance primitives
- Cross-domain policy negotiation

## Current focus (short-term)
- Harden RTT transport (session lifecycle, queue controls, backpressure).
- Wire CIP/HCP/LIP helpers into the runtime loop.
- Add protocol validation tests + minimal integration scenario.
