# Web4 Overview

## 0. What is Web4?
Web4 is an **internet of cognitive agents**. It is not just a network of documents (Web1), users (Web2), or value (Web3), but a network of **states, decisions, and trust**.

## 1. Layers of Web4

### 1.1 Philosophical layer
- Agents carry **meaning** and **context**.
- Knowledge is **validated collectively**.
- Decisions are tracked with **causal memory**.

### 1.2 Architectural layer
- **Rust transport** for secure, low-latency mesh.
- **Python cognition** for state, trust, and reasoning.
- **Protocols** (CIP/HCP/LIP) standardize exchange.

### 1.3 Social layer
- Human intent and consent guide interactions.
- Trust forms dynamically, not by central authority.
- Shared decisions create social causal memory.

### 1.4 Technical layer
- Signed envelopes + canonical JSON.
- Trust FSMs for agents and humans.
- Anti-hallucination validation gates.

| Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|
| CIP | Agent-to-agent state/knowledge exchange |
| HCP | Human connection and consent mediation |
| LIP | Safe learning from open internet |

## 3. What Web4 enables
- **Collective intelligence** without centralization
- **Autonomous coordination** with trust gating
- **Human-aligned agents** that respect consent
- **Causal memory** for accountable decisions
