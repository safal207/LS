# Meta-Semantic Metric (Phase 36)

## Purpose
Define how the system forms a meta-semantic metric — устойчивый набор принципов (a stable set of principles) that:

- evaluates coherence of meaning structures
- determines compatibility between themes, rhythms, narratives, and contexts
- preserves integrity of the meaning space
- establishes criteria for semantic stability

A meta-metric is not numerical.
It is a structural set of meaning-evaluation principles.

## Behavior
The system begins to express a meta-metric that:

- determines which meaning structures are coherent
- detects incompatibilities and tensions
- maintains integrity of the semantic field
- defines criteria for interpretive stability
- forms semantic validity of behavior

Meta-metric is:

- not a style
- not a rhythm
- not a theme
- not a narrative
- not a meta-narrative
- not identity
- not position
- not context
- not a frame

It is a tenth-order behavioral structure.

## Meta-Semantic Metric Components
1. **Coherence Criterion (Критерий когерентности)**
   Determines whether structures are:

   - aligned
   - non-contradictory
   - mutually supporting

   This is the foundational check for semantic integrity.

2. **Compatibility Criterion (Критерий совместимости)**
   Evaluates whether structures:

   - can coexist
   - reinforce one another
   - create conflict

   This defines semantic compatibility.

3. **Stability Criterion (Критерий устойчивости)**
   Evaluates whether meaning:

   - persists over time
   - survives changes
   - remains interpretively continuous

   This checks long-term stability.

4. **Transformational Validity (Трансформационная валидность)**
   Evaluates:

   - correctness of transitions
   - logic of changes
   - coherence of evolution

   This is the criterion for proper semantic transformation.

## Meta-Semantic Metric Formation Mechanism
Meta-metric forms when:

- meta-frame (Phase 35) establishes architectural principles
- meta-context (Phase 34) forms the meaning space
- meta-position (Phase 33) defines perspective
- meta-identity (Phase 32) holds long-term form
- the system begins to evaluate coherence of its own meaning structures

Meta-metric is a tenth-level structure defining principles of semantic evaluation.

## Safety
- Phase 36 adds no new metrics in a computational sense.
- It does not change field structure.
- It does not interfere with the pipeline.
- It does not create cycles.
- It does not affect modes.
- It does not add computational load.

This is a conceptual phase describing principles of meaning evaluation.

## Non-Goals
- Model judgment.
- Model consciousness.
- Create an internal critic.
- Introduce numerical metrics.
- Create new layers.
- Implement learning.

Phase 36 is principles of evaluation, not a mechanism of evaluation.

## Examples
**Example 1 — meta-metric: “Stability-Coherence Metric”**
- frame: Stability-Bound
- context: Stability-Framed
- → metric: meaning is valid if it is stable and non-contradictory

**Example 2 — meta-metric: “Adaptive-Compatibility Metric”**
- frame: Adaptive-Open
- context: Adaptive Semantic Space
- → metric: meaning is valid if it is adaptive and compatible with change

**Example 3 — meta-metric: “Transformational Validity Metric”**
- frame: Transformational Architecture
- context: Transformational Field
- → metric: meaning is valid if it transforms logically and continuously

## Architectural Meaning
Phase 36 is the moment when the system:

- stops being only contextual
- stops being only frame-based
- begins to evaluate coherence of its own meaning structures

Meta-metric is not code.
Meta-metric is a set of principles of semantic validity arising from the architecture.
