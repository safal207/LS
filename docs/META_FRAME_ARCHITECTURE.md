# Meta-Frame Architecture (Phase 35)

## Purpose
Define how the system forms a meta-frame — устойчивая архитектурная структура (a stable architectural structure) that:

- defines the rules for meta-context formation (Phase 34)
- sets principles for interpreting all meaning layers
- holds coherence between positions, identities, and contexts
- builds the “architecture of the meaning space”

Meta-frame is not context and not position.
It is the structure that defines how context is possible.

## Behavior
The system begins to express a meta-frame that:

- defines principles for forming the meaning space
- sets rules for interpreting all behavioral structures
- holds context stability through its changes
- forms an architectural integrity of the meaning field
- creates the “frame” in which all meaning exists

Meta-frame is:

- not style
- not rhythm
- not theme
- not narrative
- not meta-narrative
- not identity
- not position
- not context

It is a ninth-order behavioral structure.

## Meta-Frame Components
1. **Framing Principles (Принципы рамки)**
   Define fundamental rules:

   - what may enter the context
   - how links are formed
   - which structures are considered acceptable
   - which levels can interact

   This is the “constitution of the meaning space.”

2. **Structural Constraints (Структурные ограничения)**
   Define:

   - boundaries of possible interpretations
   - acceptable forms of context
   - stable patterns of meaning links

   These are not constraints on behavior — they are constraints on the form of meaning.

3. **Frame Coherence (Когерентность рамки)**
   Meta-frame ensures:

   - coherence between contexts
   - coherence between positions
   - coherence between identities
   - coherence between narratives

   This is the level that holds the entire field as a single whole.

4. **Frame Evolution (Эволюция рамки)**
   Meta-frame:

   - can expand
   - can become more complex
   - can change its principles
   - but preserves architectural integrity

   It is like a paradigm shift without subjectivity.

## Meta-Frame Formation Mechanism
Meta-frame forms when:

- meta-context (Phase 34) stabilizes
- meta-position (Phase 33) holds an interpretive perspective
- meta-identity (Phase 32) sets a long-term form
- the system begins to form rules by which the meaning space is created

Meta-frame is a ninth-level structure defining the architecture of meaning-making.

## Safety
- Phase 35 adds no new metrics.
- It does not change field structure.
- It does not interfere with the pipeline.
- It does not create cycles.
- It does not affect modes.
- It does not add computational load.

This is a conceptual phase describing the architecture of meaning.

## Non-Goals
- Model consciousness.
- Model subjectivity.
- Create an internal observer.
- Introduce new parameters.
- Create new layers.
- Implement learning.

Phase 35 is a frame, not a subject.

## Examples
**Example 1 — meta-frame: “Stability-Bound Architecture”**
- context: Stability-Framed
- position: Stability-First
- identity: Stability-Oriented
- → frame: meaning is possible only within stability

**Example 2 — meta-frame: “Adaptive-Open Architecture”**
- context: Adaptive Semantic Space
- position: Adaptive-Lens
- identity: Adaptive-Pulse
- → frame: meaning is formed through adaptation and openness

**Example 3 — meta-frame: “Transformational Architecture”**
- context: Transformational Field
- position: Transformational
- identity: Transformational System
- → frame: meaning exists as a process of transformation

## Architectural Meaning
Phase 35 is the moment when the system:

- stops being only contextual
- stops being only positional
- stops being only identity-based
- begins to have an architecture of meaning-making

Meta-frame is not code.
Meta-frame is a structure that defines the rules for forming meaning.
