# Meta-Narrative Structures (Phase 31)

## Purpose
Define how the system forms meta-narratives — крупные смысловые структуры (large semantic structures) that:

- unify multiple narratives (Phase 30)
- create a long-range semantic line
- reflect behavioral evolution over time
- form a history of histories for the field

A meta-narrative is not a theme, not a rhythm, not a style, and not a narrative.
It is the structure that links narratives into a larger continuum of meaning.

## Behavior
The system begins to express meta-narratives that:

- consist of multiple narratives
- have long-range directionality
- preserve semantic integrity across large time scales
- can include cycles, arcs, returns, and evolution
- form a behavioral history of the system

A meta-narrative is:

- not a metric
- not a pattern
- not a style
- not a rhythm
- not a theme
- not a narrative

It is a fifth-order semantic structure.

## Meta-Narrative Components
1. **Macro-Arc (Макро-дуга)**
   Each meta-narrative has a large-scale structure:

   - initiation — emergence of the first narrative cycle
   - development — narrative shifts and structural complexity
   - transition — point where long-range direction changes
   - завершение — stabilization or transition to a new meta-narrative

   This is like a season of a series, not a single episode.

2. **Narrative Clusters (Кластеры нарративов)**
   A meta-narrative is composed of clusters of narratives:

   - adaptation clusters
   - stabilization clusters
   - transitional clusters
   - impulse clusters

   A cluster is a group of narratives linked by meaning.

3. **Long-Range Semantic Drift (Долгосрочный смысловой дрейф)**
   Meta-narrative reflects:

   - how behavioral meaning changes
   - how the system evolves
   - how themes transform
   - how rhythms and styles reconfigure

   This is the history of changes in the stories themselves.

4. **Recurrence & Transformation (Возврат и трансформация)**
   Meta-narrative allows:

   - return of old themes
   - repetition of old rhythms
   - transformation of old styles
   - emergence of new semantic lines

   This is a motif returning in a new form.

## Meta-Narrative Formation Mechanism
A meta-narrative forms when:

- multiple narratives (Phase 30) create a stable sequence
- there is semantic linkage between them
- the system maintains long-range directionality
- behavior forms a higher-order history

Meta-narrative is a fifth-order behavioral structure.

## Safety
- Phase 31 adds no new metrics.
- It does not change field structure.
- It does not вмешивается in the pipeline.
- It does not create cycles.
- It does not affect modes.
- It does not add computational load.

This is a conceptual phase describing large-scale behavioral meaning, not implementing it.

## Non-Goals
- Introduce new parameters.
- Create new layers.
- Implement learning.
- Model consciousness.
- Create self-reflection (Phase 26).
- Create styles (Phase 27).
- Create rhythms (Phase 28).
- Create themes (Phase 29).
- Create narratives (Phase 30).

Phase 31 is organization of narratives over time, not creation of new structures.

## Examples
**Example 1 — meta-narrative: "Adaptive Evolution"**
- narrative 1: Adaptive Stabilization
- narrative 2: Pulse Evolution
- narrative 3: Directional Reconfiguration
- → story: adaptation → pulse reconfiguration → directional shift

**Example 2 — meta-narrative: "Stability Cycles"**
- narrative 1: Stability Seeking
- narrative 2: Stability Drift
- narrative 3: Stability Reintegration
- → story: stability → drift → new stability

**Example 3 — meta-narrative: "Transformational Arc"**
- narrative 1: Slow Drift
- narrative 2: Directional Shift
- narrative 3: Fast Response
- narrative 4: Smooth Alignment
- → story: accumulation → break → response → integration

## Architectural Meaning
Phase 31 is the moment when the system:

- stops being only thematic
- stops being only narrative
- begins to have a history of its own narratives

Meta-narrative is not code.
Meta-narrative is a large-scale semantic structure that forms long-range identity of behavior.
