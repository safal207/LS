# CaPU v3.2 — Core Cognitive Principles

**Foundational mechanisms enabling a self‑regulating cognitive system**

These principles define the conceptual foundation of CaPU v3.2.
Phase 1 (Homeostasis & Compression) implements the first layer of these mechanisms, and the Stress Test Suite validates their behavior.

## 1. Diversity Metabolism
**The Exploration Tax** introduces controlled randomness into the reasoning process, functioning as a biological mutation mechanism.
It prevents cognitive stagnation and ensures the system continues exploring alternative paths instead of collapsing into a local optimum.

*   **Outcome:** Sustained adaptability and long‑term learning capacity.

---

## 2. Belief Maturity
**The Anti‑Promotion Cooldown** enforces temporal resilience: a belief must survive time, decay cycles, and validation gaps before it can be promoted to a principle.
This prevents the formation of fragile or accidental core beliefs.

*   **Outcome:** Stable, reliable, non‑fragile belief structures.

---

## 3. Temporal Causality
**The Temporal Contradiction Detector** shifts reasoning from event correlation to causal understanding.
The system evaluates both short‑term and long‑term outcomes, preventing short‑term successes from being misinterpreted as long‑term truths.

*   **Outcome:** Accurate causal models and resistance to reward‑hacking.

---

## 4. Cognitive Immunity
**The Blind Spot Checker and Mission Drift Brakes** form an internal immune system.
They prevent layer suppression, ideological drift, runaway reinforcement loops, and the loss of critical cognitive functions.

*   **Outcome:** Long‑term structural integrity and protection against self‑reinforcing errors.
